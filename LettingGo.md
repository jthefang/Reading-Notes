- Chapter 6: Fear
  - Fear is the predominant emotion in the world. It is our most basic survival mechanism and thus enjoys a privileged status amongst our mind's programs.
  - A good starting point is letting go the fear of fear itself. When we stop beign afraid of fear, we notice that it is just a feeling.
  - Fear is self-reinforcing. One of the laws of consciousness is **what one holds in mind tends to manifest**. Any thought which we consistently hold i mind and consistently give energy to will tend to come into our life according to the very form in which our mind has held it. Thus fear engenders fearful thoughts. The more we hold these thoughts in mind, the more likely the feared event will happen in our life, which again reinforces our fear.
    - Just like love attracts love, the more fear we hold, the more fearful situations we attract to our life.
    - You thinking about something gives energy into making it a reality. Therefore it is especially important to stop feeding fear and letting them go.
    - Fear tends to progressively extend into more and mroe avenues of life, leading to further and further restrictions of activity. Letting go of fearful inhibitions allows us to become more capable, freer, and happier, and with that, there is an inner peace of mind.
  - Fear is healed by love. Higher vibration, such as love, has a healing effect on a lower vibration, such as fear. This love is the mechanism of reassurance, and very often we can quiet another person's fears by our mere physical presence, and by the loving energy that we project to them and with which we surround them. It is not what we say, but the very fact of our presence that has the healing effect.
    - By letting go the energy caught up in sustaining our fears and defensive mechanisms, we thereby have more energy for love. Our capacity to love increases, and loving energy has the capacity to heal ourselves and others.
    - We might picture love to be like the sunlight and negative thoughts like the clouds. Whereas our higher greater Self is like the sun, all the negative thoughts, doubts, fears, anger and resentments that we hold dim the light of the sun and finally, the light comes through only weakly.
  - We have fear of ourselves as well, of what lies buried in our unconscious. We project our shadow onto the world and condemn it and see it as evil. And we think it is our problem to battle with evil in the world. In actuality, the problem is merely to acknowledge the rpesence of such thoughts and impulses in ourselves. By acknowledging them, they become quiet. Once they are quiet, they no longer unconsciously run us.
    - To do this it's useful to have a sense of humor. It is only our fear of these thoughts and impulses that give them any power.
    - The images conjured by our shadow, our dark impulses, are actually rather comical. There is nothing awful about it; it is just the way the unconscious handles images. It doesn't mean you're rotten or a criminal, you've just gotten acquainted with how the human animal mind operates in this dimension. The unconscious is crude and uncivilized. It's not time to get squeamish, nor to take the symbols seriously. They are just symbols that are primitive in nature.
    - It takes a lot of energy to keep these thoughts of the 'shadow' buried. This results in energy depletion. 
  - There is a mistaken belief that our fears are what is keeping us alive, because fear is deeply associated with our survival mechanisms. We think letting go of them will leave us vulnerable in some way. The reality is the opposite. Fear blinds us to the real dangers of life. That we are surrendering our freedom and destroying our psyche and physiology. Fear itself is the greatest danger that the human body faces. It is fear and guilt that bring about disease and failure in every area of our lives.
    - We could take the same protective actions our of love rather than out of fear. Can we not care for our bodies because we appreciate and value them, rather than out of fear of disease and dying? Can we not be of service to others in our life out of love, rather than out of fear of losing them? Can we not be polite and courteous to strangers because we care for our fellow human beings, rather than because we fear losing their good opinion of us? Can we not do a good job because we care about the quality of our performance and we care about our fellow workers and the recipients of our services, rather than just the fear of losing our jobs or pursuing our own ambition? Can we not accomplish more by cooperation, rather than by fearful competition?
  - One form of fear is guilt. It's a substitute for a sense of reality in a mind that is undeveloped, to prevent further error or the repetition of a mistake. 99% of guilt has nothing whatsoever to do with reality. The most pious, meek and harmless individuals are often riddled with guilt.
    - We feel guilty no matter what we are doing. A part of our mind says that we really ought to be doing something else. OR whatever we are actually doing at the moment, we ought to be doing it 'better'. In between the fear of living and the fear of dying is the guilt of the moment.
    - Guilt is the denial of our inner intrinsic innocence. Why do we buy into so much garbage? Is it not because of our very innocence? We were all born a blank slate, and society's programs and beliefs were forced upon us because we trusted them. We bought into 10000 lies and are willing to buy another 10000 out of the naivete of our inner innocence. It's because of our very innocence that we believe ourselves to be guilty. We have bought into allt h negativity of the world and allowed it to kill our aliveness, destroy our awareness of who we really are, and sell us the pathetic little smallness for which we have settled.
    - Is not ours the innocence of the newborn that cannot defend itself and, with no capacity for discernment, could only allow itself to be programmed, like a computer?
    - People make entire livings off of exploiting our innocence and invalidating our self-worth, enslaving us to their cause, manipulating us so they can control us, living off of our energy, money, and time.
    - All of the things the world calls 'evil' are right on the surface; they are right on the top, as the superficial, outer thin layer. Beneath these errors is mistakenness. We are not rotten - only ignorant.
- Chapter 7: Desire
  - This is the feeling of acquisitiveness. Never satisfied. Never enough. Must have. The underlying desire of this emotion is its drivenness. When we are at the effect of desire, we are no longer free. We are controlled by it, run by it, enslaved and led about by the nose by it. The essential point of reedom is whether we have chosen consciously to fulfill a certain want, or whether we are just being blindly run by unconscious programs and belief systems.
  - We mistakenly believe that the only way to get what we want is by desiring it intensely. Paradoxically, this prevents us from attaining it since it comes from a belief that we lack it. We are putting psychic distance between ourselves and what we want. It becomes an obstacle that consumes energy. 
    - Remember that which we hold in our minds comes true. Our persistent desire blocks receiving it and results in fear of not getting it. It is a denial that what we want is ours for the asking.
    - The way something comes into our life is because we have chosen it. It was the result of our intention, or we made a decision for it. In a freer state, that which is chosen manifests in our life effortlessly. We surrender the emotion of desire, and instead meerely choose the goal, picture it lovingly, and allow it to happen because we see that it is already ours. Identify goals and then let go of wanting them. Being totally surrendered means it's okay if it happens (we get what we want), and it's okay if it doesn't (we don't).
    - Although the world may be stingy and hostile to other people, there is no reason why we should buy into this paradigm. When we buy into it, we make it that way in our own life. What we hold in mind tends to manifest almost magically.
  - One obstacle in the way of this effortless way of achieving goals is the belief that we must struggle and toil to get what we want. But there is no reason why this should be. If it weren't for the negative programming that made us believe otherwise, why should we go through any cost of pain and suffering to achieve anything in our life? Isn't that a rather sadistic view of the universe? Align your energy to allow luck to happen for you!
  - The unconscious will only allow us to have what we think we deserve. The more we hang on to our negativity and the small self-image that results, the less we think we deserve, and we unconsciously deny ourselves the abundance which flows so easily to others. Relinquish your smallness, revalidate your own inner innocence. Let go resisting your generosity, openness, trust, lovingness, and faith.
  - Havingness to doingness to beingness. At lower levels of consciousness, it is what we have that we value and desire and use to evaluate our self-image. Once we have proven to ourselves that we can have, then what we do in the owrld is the basis of our value. Doingness becomes less focused on self-service and more on loving service to others. That eventually automatically results fulfillment of our own needs (note service is not sacrifice). Eventually, we become convinced that our own needs are automatically fulfilled by the universe, and our actions become almost automatically loving. At this point, it is what we are that counts, within ourselves and to others. It's the quality of our presence.
  - Glamour is the aura, attractice magnetic effect, belief in some magical quality attached to an object of desire. It should be distinguished from the object itself. It is the sentimentality attached that leads us to make the object bigger than life. It makes us believe that obtaining it will grant us some higher state of consciousness and satisfaction. This glamour is the disparity that often leads to disillusionment once we attain the object.  
    - We also attach glamour to certain events in our lives, which also causes disappointment. When we let go of desire, we must dissect away that which is exaggeration, fantasy, and romanticization. Once we have relinquished the glamour, it will be relatively easy to surrender the desire itself.
  - Just choose to be that person and let go of the block of desiring to be that way.
    - Simply picture the kind of person we want to be and surrender allt he negative feelings and blocks that prevent us from being that. What happens then is that all we need to have and to do will automatically fall into place. This is because, in constrast to having and doing, the level of being has the most power and energy. When it is given priority, it automatically integrates and organizes one's activites.
    - Be able to recognize your own inner power. We tend to attribute luck or success to things external to us. But almost everything that happens to us is simply because we allow it to happen! We are all powerful beings who have become unconscious of our own power; we have denied and projected it onto others out of guilt and our own sense of smallness. The majority of what happens in our lifetime is the result of some decision we have made somewhere in the past, either consciously or unconsciously. Therefore the solution is to make those decisions consciously!
  - Cancel negative programs starting by relinquishing the gratification we get out of the negative payoffs. Guilt is self-indulgence. There is no winning the guilt game. That's why selfishness is impractical. It consumes too much energy. It delays the accomplishment of goals from coming from a place of lack. It creates self-perpetuating guilt. And after we achieve success, we feel guilty because we have it.
  - Summary: instead of the motivation of selfishness and desire, we can much more effortlessly bring into our life that which we want by envisioning what we wish to have happen. We do this by declaration of our intention, by acceptance, by decision, and by the act of consciously choosing.
