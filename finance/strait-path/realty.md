# Chapter 2: Overview
1. Plan 
	- identify all your assests and resources
	- create a 10 year plan to give structure to your investing
	- stick to the plan no matter what and keep reinvesting your profits, especially in the early years. Scrape the most out of your profits
2. Find
	- single family homes with 3+ bedrooms and with 15%+ equity
	- need to know where to look, how to look, what to look for, and speed
	- the right property:
		- only single-family homes (not townhomes, condods, duplexes, multiplexes)
		- never invest in homes priced above the median in the area. This will increase the risk of losing equity from market volatility and being unable to resell for a profit
		- the price range of entry-level to median will always have a market no matter how bad the market is
		- only buy homes in livable condition (want least amount of investment to make it resellable). Don't waste time on fixer-uppers. Ugly, but livable houses can still produce huge cash flows, but they must be in good enough condition that we can find tenants/potential buyers for them.
	- power of speed:
		- be prepared to purchase homes beforehand (be prequalified by a mortage broker)
		- be the first to find deals
		- have efficient negotiation (same day!)
			- avoid tedious counteroffers, cut to the chase
3. Purchase
	- use the right broker, select the right loans, manage your debt-to-income ratio
	- the right broker: find the right mortgage broker who understands how to finance multiple properties on one person’s credit
	- select the right loans: Also, maximizing the benefits of our formula requires that investors learn how to become profit conscious, rather than rate conscious. Higher interest rates can make investors more money than lower rates. Because the goal is to finance as many homes as possible, each additional property may be funded at a higher interest rate. Paying higher interest rates to particular banks enables us to purchase twice the investment properties as compared to what we could do if we went with the banks with the lowest rates
	- optimize debt-to-income ratio through compassionate financing. The higher your debt is relative to your income, the less likely you are to get additional loans. Through Compassionate Financing, our proprietary hybrid rent-to-own system, you can collect between $300 and $600 per month more than is possible through renting out properties. This offsets the debt incurred by additional loans and increases your ability to purchase additional investment properties. This is opposed to renting, where your debt-to-income ratio worsens with each transaction, and usually kills your ability to grow your portfolio after you’ve purchased a couple of homes.

4. Compassionate Financing
	- rent-to-own program similar to lease options but eliminates some of the flaws
		- A lease option gives renters the opportunity to purchase a home within a specified period of time and if certain conditions are met. Renters like the lease option because it offers a gateway to home ownership. Investors like the lease option because it allows them to collect an option consideration (down payment) and receive a higher lease payment than they would otherwise receive in rent. 
	- Unlike rentals, with Compassionate Financing there is no property maintenance for investors, since the contract stipulates that tenants are responsible for all maintenance. The only time and effort involved is in marketing the property, screening tenants, and putting contracts in place.
	- relieves investors of time and effort needed to maintain rentals
	- more profit + substantial benefits to tenants
		- You receive anywhere from $50 to a few hundred dollars more per month than rentals.
		- You collect a down payment (technically an “option consideration”) up front that equates to an extra $100 to $300 per month over the course of the contract.
		- You don’t pay $75 to $150 per month in property management fees.
			- the contract stipulates that tenants are responsible for all maintenance. The only time and effort involved is in marketing the property, screening tenants, and putting contracts in place
		- You never have to pay for repairs, which can add up to an extra $50 to $250 per month with rentals, if not more.
		- The above four points increase profits $300-800 per month as compared to rentals
		- You can sell the property on the back end for at least its current market value, which is often not possible with rentals because tenants often do not maintain rental properties, causing them to decrease in value. Typically, if an investor chooses to sell a rental property after renting it out for a couple of years, he or she must either spend a lot of money to fix it up or knock 10 percent or more off the asking price to attract buyers.
		- It lowers your debt-to-income ratio relative to rentals, which means that you can purchase more properties.
		- You save 6 percent on realtor fees when the home sells.
		- it gives tenants the opportunity to make improvements and feel as if they’re really creating a home environment, which is difficult for renters to achieve. Tenants have the feeling of control and ownership while they are buying time to improve their credit. 
		- They can build equity much faster than they can with conventional financing. They can acquire seasoned loans since they are living in the home before purchasing it. They can take advantage of the opportunity of home ownership with a relatively small amount of money. And with our system, it’s almost a guarantee that they will, in fact, be able to purchase the home. Furthermore, we encourage investors to give tenants an equity bonus when they purchase the home.

# Chapter 3
- 6 key elements to successful investing:
	- Time (too much time?)
	- Effort (too much effort?)
	- Risk (too risky?)
	- Service (doesn't provide a service?)
	- Market volatility (too dependent on market?)
	- Profitability
- The following are not as good real estate strategies (as compared to compassionate financing): rentals; fix-and-flip; lease options; speculative building; equity leveraging; distress sales, including short sales and foreclosures; land development, residential development, and commercial development; and multi-unit investing
- Time 
	- Time is more valuable than money. You can get more money, but you cannot get more time.
	- The ability to delegate is one of your greatest tools
		- leverage the time, talents, and efforts of others while still managing the investment responsibly
	- The more time you spend on one deal = less time on creating multiple deals
	- a true investment should demand passive participation
	- How much time will this investment require?
	- Are there ways that I can reduce the amount of time I spend on each deal?
	- How can I leverage the time, talents, and efforts of other people while still managing the investment responsibly?
- Effort
	- work smart, not hard. Don't burn out
		- is this strategy sustainable?
	- is the work your putting in creating real market value (good) or perceived value (worthless)
	- are you engaged in acutal productivity or mere activity
	- How much effort and hands-on involvement will this investment require?
	- How can I reduce my effort?
	- Are the returns worth the effort?
	- Is this sustainable—can I keep putting forth this much energy for a long period of time, or will I burn out?
- Risk
 	- high risk => high reward and low risk => low reward is myth perpetuated by those with vested interests trying to transfer all the risk to you
 	- investing can be both safe and lucrative; requires you to have more control (good) and be more actively involved. No amount of money is worth the fear, anxiety, and uncertainty. 
 	- How risky is this investment?
 	- What’s the likelihood of its success/failure?
 	- What guarantees does this investment carry? 
 	- Is this investment collateralized?
 	- Do I have a solid exit strategy?
 	- What options do I have if things go wrong?
 	- How can I reduce my risk as much as possible? 
- Service to others
	- If you help enough people get what they want, you will get what you want
	- enjoy peace of mind, self-respect and wealth
	- only sustainable, legitimate and worth path to wealth is to create real value for others (serve people on their terms)
	- How well does this system/strategy serve others?
	- How could it better serve others?
	- Is this system fair and equitable?
	- Does it create win/lose scenarios in any form and to any degree?
	- Does it take advantage of fear, greed, and/or desperation?
	- Will it put everyone else involved in the transaction in a better, or a worse, situation?
- Market volatility
	- your strategy should not depend on the market (that's speculation)
	- appreciate due to rising markets is icing on the cake, but not necessary to enjoy sweet deals
	- Will this system/strategy work in every market?
	- Can I earn a profit when the market is going up and when the market is going down?
	- How protected am I from market volatility?
	- How far does the market have to drop before I am adversely affected?
	- Do I have a long-term strategy to profit if the market does drop so low that it hurts me?
	- How big is the market for this investment? Is it a broad, or a niche market?
	- __What percentage of people will be able to afford this investment?__
- Profitability
	- It's not how much money you make, but __how much you keep, how hard it works for you, and how many generations you keep it for.__
	- money is a tool and a byproduct to creating value for others and yourself, not an end itself
	- don't focus on pure profit. we seek sustainable, consistent, and predictable profits. We don’t want the highest returns — we want the best returns when considered in light of every other investment factor
	- 5 profit centers of our strategy 1) discount equity, 2) cash flow, 3) down payment, 4) appreciation, 5) tax benefits:
	1. Discount equity is the difference between the market value and the pruchase price of the home
		- you want 15%+ equity on your purchase
		- depends on size of home and discount purchase price
		- If home worth $100k, you purchase it for $85k, you just made $15k on the purchase alone (i.e. you own 15% equity)
	2. Cash flow is the monthly amount you receive from your tenants minus your monthly mortage payment (the difference between them)
	3. Down payment ("option consideration") is the fee paid by tenants to secure their opportunity to purchase the home within a specified period of time
		- nonrefundable, average is $5,000 down per house
	4. Appreciation is rise in value of a property over time due to increased demand (market dependent)
	5. Tax benefits
		- able to deduct mortage interest from taxes
- Summary of analysis questions:
	- How much profit can I create from this investment?
	- Am I benefiting from as many profit centers as possible, or am I missing out on other potential sources of profitability?
	- Is the profit worth the amount of time, effort, and risk involved?
	- How certain is my profit from this deal, even if the market drops?
	- Am I deriving profit in an ethical manner?
	- Do I have a system in place to create sustainable, consistent, and predictable profits, or is this a one-time strategy?
- Good bad and ugly:
1. Rentals
	- Good: monthly cash flow (though could still be negative due to mortage payments), usually rentals are in demand, if you hold long enough the property will appreciate, tax benefits by writing off mortage payments
	- Bad: time/effort fulfilling landlord duties, most people sell at loss because they get too fed up with the hassle, difficult to get postiive cash flow for rentals in first few years, high occupancy turnover = constantly looking for new tenants
	- Ugly: renters damage the home, your responsible for all repairs (furnaces, air conditioners, garage doors, appliances), must paint the home, replace carpet periodically
		- on call 24 hours unless you hire an expensive property management co.
		- rentals located in undesireable neighborhoods increases risk (in finding tenant and damage to house)
		- significantly less revenue than our strategy
2. Fix-and-flip
	- too much investment of time and effort for a risky profit
	- avoid houses above the median price in the area
	- Good: done right, you buy at a significant discount (because of dilapidated state) = significant up-front equity that mitigates risk
	- Bad: difference between market value and perceived value and you must put in a lot of time and effort into perceived value for buyers that doesn't actually raise the price of the home
		- major time investment
		- lending requirements make it extremely difficult to get an accurate appraisal within a few months (banks are less willing to account for a huge jump in value, seems like a red flag = makes it harder to sell the house quickly)
	- Ugy:
		- there are capital gains taxes, realtor fees, monthly payments, fix-up costs, and depreciation to account for
		- you must sell it fast, and this creates a reliance on the market
		- most need to purchased with 40-50% equity to be profitable; very difficult to find
3. Lease options
	- tenants lease a home for a monthly amount, securing the option to purchase the home under the terms of an agreement (gateway to home ownership for renters)
	- Good: 
		- monthly cash flow is generally at least $200 per month higher than what is garnered with comparable rentals because lessees are willing to pay more for the benefits they’re receiving
		- The higher monthly lease payments improve the investor’s debt-to-income ratios, thus increasing his or her ability to finance more homes. With rentals, an investor’s credit is often maxed out after acquiring just a few properties.
		- nonrefundable down payment
		- no property maintenance (tenant assumes all responsibility for repairs and improvements)
		- mortage tax deductions since you own the home
		- save 6% on realtor fees when the home sells
		- cheap up-front cost for tenants to get into a home which they feel as if it's their own (because it will be); can make home improvements and are not throwing away rent money (paying it on the home)
		- buy time for tenants to repair their credit and prepare for traditional financing
		- they can walk away from the home with no liability
		- the transaction doesn't show up on the buyer's credit
	- Bad:
		- Traditional lease-option contracts create an inevitable win-lose scenario on the back-end sale by setting a purchase price up front. If the property appreciates, the investor loses; if the property depreciates, the tenant loses.
		- Lease options have a high failure rate, meaning that most tenants will not be able to secure traditional financing by the end of the term. 
	- Ugly: 
		- Many investors use lease options to prey on unsuspecting, naïve homebuyers. They collect a large down payment, and then, when the tenants are unable to purchase the home, they get rid of them and bring in new suckers. They cycle tenants through to collect hefty down payments. 
4. Distress sales
	- short sales, foreclosures, auctions, divorce sales, etc. The idea is to find people in bad and/or urgent situations who need to sell quickly. Whatever the reason, these sellers are willing to sell their homes at far below market value. 
	- Good:
		- These homes can be purchased at substantial discounts, thus decreasing the investor’s risk.
		- When done properly (and contrary to popular thinking), this actually performs a valuable service for people who feel lucky to be rid of the burden. In many cases, they would have lost the home to foreclosure anyway, so it saves them from damaging their credit for years.
	- Bad
		- __Fierce competition__ among investors clamoring for the same properties makes these properties much more difficult to obtain.
		- It generally __takes a lot of time and effort__ to identify the right properties, especially since many of them are “for sale by owner”; finding these “nonlistings” requires a lot of driving and legwork.
		- Since the primary focus is on the initial purchase, the back-end liquidation strategy is often neglected.
		- Distressed properties become increasingly difficult to find in boom markets. In other words, the strategy is __market dependent__.
	- Ugly
		- This type of investing can degenerate and become predatory when done by the wrong people, and in the wrong ways.
